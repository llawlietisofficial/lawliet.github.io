        <h1 class="letter">Greetings, the reader of this page. <br>Well, this world requires a change. A change in their mentality. So here am I, a successor of L, (an imaginary character), and convert his name into a real life entity. One who could finish sorrow, bring
            joy, make nation friends, end the wars, and my favorite, solving problems for the future generation. Though my lifespan is very, i repeat, very short for this duty, I would find a new person who is able to carry the name of L. <br><br>Thanks
            for reading till end
            <br>L. Lawliet
