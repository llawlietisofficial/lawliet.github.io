        <h2 class="goals">My goals are to end the concept of war, bring equality into existence, and as L would do, give my opinions about incidents that seem to shatter our dream of a better world. To make children recieve better "education" and to solve cases just like
            my ancestor, L. Another aim of mine is to make this world a better place for children and teenagers, as they are the basis of the society. <br><br>L. Lawliet</h2>
